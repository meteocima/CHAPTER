# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a **single-context** repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-....md
│   └── 0002-....md
└── src/
```

(If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` ever appears at the root, the repo has been split into multiple contexts: read the map, then each per-context `CONTEXT.md` relevant to the topic, and also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.)

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_

## Note for this repo

Neither `CONTEXT.md` nor `docs/adr/` exists yet. Much of what would go in them currently
lives in `CLAUDE.md` (the GRIB2 variable schema, the measured `skt` emissivity, the refuted
hypotheses, the HPC gotchas) and in `MISSING_VARIABLES.md`. When `/domain-modeling` does
create a `CONTEXT.md`, it should point at those rather than restate them.
